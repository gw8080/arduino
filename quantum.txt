Ghostprotocol V1 A steady rising value checked against a retrocausal qubit can determine any number if enough repetitions are made, larger numbers can be estimated by increasing the increment size of the rising number. This can be used to retrocausally predict any input into the system.


 Splitting topological photons with a polarising strip, then comparing information of delay and intensity of the reflection and measuring correlations of each side and counting them with static switching of programmatic observation and synced harmonic oscillations included within detection, length or variences of calculation influences potential correlations makes the result more probable. to form a quantum protocol will produce a retro-causal effect in the present based on future protocol events.



Future events in a quantum protocol simmilar to the delayed choice experiment affect the present via harmonic oscillation of the programmatic observation in the present to build a stable prediction system which can predict future data when maintenance of the length of the calculation via the programmatic observation is increased, which increases the entropy of the eventual wavefunction, which destabilises the system if this is done enough times it can count and check against a  comparison of less than or equal to an integer.
